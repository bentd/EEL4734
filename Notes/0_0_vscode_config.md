## C/C++ IntelliSense

Include the directories.

And ensure C++ files have .cpp extension and not .c extension for C files (the sytanx is different).

```
${workspaceFolder}/**
/usr/local/opt/gcc/include/c++/14
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/include/c++/v1
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include
```
