Yes, **moving a shared library (`.so` file)** without updating the appropriate runtime search paths will cause the executable to fail because the dynamic linker won't be able to find the library at runtime. Shared libraries are dynamically linked at runtime, and their locations must match the paths encoded or searched for during the linking process.

---

### **Why Does It Fail?**

When you compile and link an executable against a shared library (`libtest.so`), the linker embeds the **path** to the library or assumes it will be found in standard locations. At runtime, if the library is moved, renamed, or deleted, the executable will fail with an error like:

```
error while loading shared libraries: libtest.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

### **Where Does the Runtime Linker Look for `.so` Files?**

1. **Standard System Paths**:
   - `/lib`
   - `/usr/lib`
   - `/usr/local/lib`

2. **Paths Encoded in the Executable**:
   - During linking, the linker can encode a path to the shared library (e.g., `/path/to/libs/libtest.so`). This is done with the `-rpath` or `-rpath-link` linker options.

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - **`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`**: A colon-separated list of directories where the runtime linker will look for libraries before checking system paths.

     ```bash
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/new/path/to/libs:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     ```

   - This is useful if the library has been moved to a non-standard location temporarily.

4. **Run-Time Linker Configuration**:
   - **`ldconfig`**: Updates the shared library cache used by the runtime linker.
     - Add the new directory to `/etc/ld.so.conf` or a file in `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/`.
     - Run `ldconfig` to update the linker’s cache.

5. **Symbolic Links**:
   - The dynamic linker may rely on symbolic links to locate the actual library (e.g., `libtest.so -> libtest.so.1.0.0`).
   - Moving or breaking the symlink can also cause failures.

### **How to Fix the Issue After Moving a `.so` File**

1. **Move the Library to a Standard Path**:
   - Move the library back to `/lib`, `/usr/lib`, or another standard location.

2. **Update `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`**:
   - Temporarily add the new location to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable:

     ```bash
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/new/path/to/libs:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     ./your_executable
     ```

3. **Update the Library Cache with `ldconfig`**:
   - Add the new directory to the linker’s configuration:

     ```bash
     echo "/new/path/to/libs" | sudo tee -a /etc/ld.so.conf.d/custom_libs.conf
     sudo ldconfig
     ```

4. **Relink the Executable with the New Path**:
   - If the library has been permanently moved, relink the executable with the new path using the `-rpath` option:

     ```bash
     gcc -o your_executable main.c -L/new/path/to/libs -ltest -Wl,-rpath,/new/path/to/libs
     ```

5. **Use `chrpath` to Modify the Executable’s Runtime Path**:
   - If relinking is not an option, modify the runtime path (`RPATH`) in the existing executable:

     ```bash
     chrpath -r /new/path/to/libs your_executable
     ```

### **Best Practices to Avoid Failures**

1. **Keep Libraries in Standard Locations**:
   - Install shared libraries to standard paths like `/usr/lib` or `/usr/local/lib`.

2. **Use Relative Paths**:
   - During linking, use relative paths to shared libraries to ensure portability.

3. **Document Library Dependencies**:
   - Clearly document where the libraries are located and include setup scripts to configure environment variables or `ldconfig`.

4. **Use Static Libraries for Critical Dependencies**:
   - For dependencies that shouldn’t move or change, consider using static libraries (`.a`) instead of shared libraries (`.so`).
