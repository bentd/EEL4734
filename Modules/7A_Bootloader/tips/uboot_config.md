The `am335x_boneblack_vboot_defconfig` configuration file was previously available in the U-Boot repository but has been removed in recent versions. This configuration was tailored for the BeagleBone Black with support for verified boot processes. Its removal suggests that the U-Boot maintainers have consolidated configurations or deprecated certain features.

For building U-Boot for the BeagleBone Black, it is now recommended to use the `am335x_evm_defconfig` configuration. This configuration supports multiple AM335x-based boards, including the BeagleBone Black. To build U-Boot using this configuration, execute the following commands:

```bash
make am335x_evm_defconfig
make
```

This approach aligns with current U-Boot development practices and ensures compatibility with the BeagleBone Black.
